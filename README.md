## Introduction
If you're a solo developer in 2023, you have the power to build robust AI software startups! Watch this 1-hour video and make an Article Summarizer Application using OpenAI's GPT model.
 
Alongside building this application, you'll also learn how to:
- setup a ReactJS project using Vite
- create a responsive, beautiful UI/UX with a nice touch of glass morphism using Tailwind CSS
- make advanced RTK query API requests that fire on condition
- save history using the local storage
- handle form events and catch errors
- implement copy to clipboard
- write clean code

# React + Vite
Its a template I used in the course of this project.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
