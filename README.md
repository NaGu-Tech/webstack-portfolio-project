## Introduction:
If you're a solo developer in 2023, I recommend the use of Next.js 13.
try out it's powerful ability and easy integration with OpenAI.

## Description of The Project:
The project is targeted at making research, reading and learning easy.
It is meant to accept url to a supposed article and then FETCH the data from the database and with the help of a reducer, its transforms the lengthy article to a smaller one.

## Learning Objectives:
Alongside building this application, I also learn how to:
- setup a ReactJS project using Vite
- create a responsive, beautiful UI/UX with a nice touch of glass morphism using Tailwind CSS
- make advanced RTK query API requests that fire on condition
- save history using the local storage
- handle form events and catch errors
- implement copy to clipboard
- write clean code

## Technologies Used:
- NEXTJS
- HTML
- CSS
- REACT
- JAVASCRIPT
- TYPESCRIPT

# React + Vite
Its a template I used in the course of this project.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
